# API Documentation

The authoritative, always-current API contract is the generated OpenAPI document,
available whenever the backend is running:

- OpenAPI JSON: `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs`
- Interactive Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`

This file summarizes what exists; the running OpenAPI document is the source of
truth if the two ever disagree.

Browser-based clients (the Milestone 4 frontend) call this API cross-origin;
see `backend/README.md#cors` and
[ADR-006](../decisions/ADR-006-frontend-backend-connectivity.md) for the CORS
allowlist that makes that possible.

## Conventions

- All endpoints are versioned under `/api/v1/`.
- List endpoints are paginated (see below) rather than returning unbounded results.
- Errors use one consistent shape across every endpoint:

  ```json
  {
    "timestamp": "2026-07-15T12:00:00Z",
    "status": 400,
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "The submitted request contains invalid information.",
    "fieldErrors": { "name": "Category name is required." }
  }
  ```

  `fieldErrors` is present only for validation-style failures; other errors omit it.
  Responses never include stack traces, SQL, table names, or internal class names —
  see `com.hfxconnect.common.error.GlobalExceptionHandler`.

- Stable error codes in use so far: `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `MALFORMED_REQUEST`,
  `NOT_FOUND` (a genuinely unmapped route — e.g. no path exists at all, as opposed to
  a specific record not being found), `CATEGORY_NOT_FOUND`, `CATEGORY_CONFLICT`,
  `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`, `RESOURCE_CONFLICT`, `INACTIVE_CATEGORY` (a resource
  referenced a real category that exists but is inactive — distinct from
  `CATEGORY_NOT_FOUND`, where the referenced category doesn't exist at all),
  `INVALID_PAGINATION`, `INVALID_SORT`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`.

## Pagination

List endpoints accept `page` (0-based, default `0`) and `size` (default `20`, maximum
`100`) query parameters and return an explicit page shape rather than Spring's raw
`Page` serialization:

```json
{
  "content": [ ... ],
  "page": 0,
  "size": 20,
  "totalElements": 6,
  "totalPages": 1
}
```

Out-of-range values (negative page, size outside `1`-`100`) return `400
INVALID_PAGINATION` rather than being silently clamped. Sorting is fixed for
categories, and allowlisted (not arbitrary) for resources — see each endpoint's own
conventions below. Arbitrary caller-specified sort fields (any entity column) are not
supported anywhere in the API; an unrecognized `sort` value returns `400
INVALID_SORT`.

## Categories — `/api/v1/categories`

Full detail: `docs/milestones/milestone-03a-category-domain.md`. Summary:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/categories` | Create a category. Slug is always derived from the name (see ADR-005) — it cannot be supplied. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/categories/{id}` | Get a category by numeric ID. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/categories/slug/{slug}` | Get a category by slug. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/categories` | Paginated list, sorted by name ascending. Optional `active` (`true`/`false`) query filter. |

**Temporary security limitation:** `POST /api/v1/categories` is not protected by
authentication yet — anyone who can reach the API can create a category.
Authentication and role-based authorization are introduced in Milestone 5. This is a
deliberate, documented limitation of this milestone, not an oversight.

### Status codes

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `201` | Category created; `Location` header points to `GET /api/v1/categories/{id}` |
| `200` | Successful retrieval or listing |
| `400` | Validation failure, malformed JSON, or invalid pagination parameters |
| `404` | No category exists with the given ID or slug |
| `409` | A category with that name or slug already exists |
| `500` | Unexpected server error (no internal detail is exposed) |

## Resources — `/api/v1/resources`

Full detail: `docs/milestones/milestone-03c-public-resource-api.md`. Summary:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/resources` | Create a resource under an existing, active category. Slug is derived from the name — it cannot be supplied. New resources always start `UNVERIFIED`. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/resources/{id}` | Get an active resource by UUID. `404` for a deactivated resource, same as an unknown ID. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/resources/slug/{slug}` | Get an active resource by slug. Same `404` behavior. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/resources` | Paginated list of **active resources only** — there is no way to include inactive resources publicly yet. Optional `categoryId` filter. Optional `sort`: `name` (default, ascending) or `createdAt` (newest first); anything else returns `400 INVALID_SORT`. |

Responses embed a small `CategorySummaryResponse` (`id`, `name`, `slug`) rather than
the full category representation. List results use a leaner
`ResourceSummaryResponse` (omits full description, contact details, and eligibility —
see `GET /api/v1/resources/{id}` for those).

**Temporary security limitation:** `POST /api/v1/resources` is not protected by
authentication yet, identical to the Category API's own documented limitation.
Authentication and role-based authorization are introduced in Milestone 5.

**No update or delete endpoint yet.** `ResourceService.update`/`deactivate` exist and
are fully tested (Milestone 3B), but are not exposed over HTTP in this milestone —
see `docs/milestones/milestone-03c-public-resource-api.md`.

### Status codes

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `201` | Resource created; `Location` header points to `GET /api/v1/resources/{id}` |
| `200` | Successful retrieval or listing |
| `400` | Validation failure, malformed JSON, invalid pagination/sort, or an inactive category (`INACTIVE_CATEGORY`) |
| `404` | No active resource exists with the given ID/slug, or the referenced category doesn't exist (`CATEGORY_NOT_FOUND`) |
| `409` | A resource with that (derived) slug already exists |
| `500` | Unexpected server error (no internal detail is exposed) |
